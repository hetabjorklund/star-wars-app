# Star Wars App

An Angular app for practising Angular and TypeScript in the [Angular Essentials course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-essentials-angular-2-angular-4-with-typescript/).

The app fetches data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/api/people/). The user can change a character's side (light or dark) and create new characters. New characters are saved locally, not sent to the API.
